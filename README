Module: Text::CSV::Unicode

Description:
    Text::CSV::Unicode builds on Text::CSV to provides facilities for the 
    composition and decomposition of comma-separated values.  
    Text::CSV::Unicode handles input that includes 8-bit (and more) data.

    It is based on version 0.01 of Text::CSV, but later versions of that
    module are not compatible with Text::CSV::Unicode, so Text-CSV-0.01
    has been integrated into this distribution as lib/Text/CSV/Base.pm 
    and t/base.t; specifically
	% perl -pwe 's/Text::CSV/Text::CSV::Base/ && s/ {6}\#/\#/' \ 
		../Text-CSV-0.01/CSV.pm  > lib/Text/CSV/Base.pm
	% perl -pwe 's/Text::CSV/Text::CSV::Base/'		   \
		../Text-CSV-0.01/test.pl > t/base.t
